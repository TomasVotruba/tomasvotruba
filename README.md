# Hi, I'm Tomas and I love Legacy

Nothing excites me more than good old legacy code. A code that can be improved light-years in matter of few-days work. Not tedious and boring work. But with smart modern automated almost-futuristic tools.

My biggest passion is **to innovate in area of "impossible" and help developers to be happier** :heart: at their daily work. If you're happy, you enjoy your work and life more, don't you? :wink:
