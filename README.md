# Hi, I'm Tomas, and I love Legacy

Nothing excites me more than good old legacy code. A code that can be improved light-years in a matter of few-days work. Not tedious and repetitive work. But with intelligent modern automated almost-futuristic tools.

My biggest passion is **to innovate in the area of "impossible" and help developers to be happier** :heart: at their daily work. 

If you're happy, you enjoy your work and life more, don't you? :wink:
