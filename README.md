# Hi, I'm Tomas, and I love Legacy

Nothing excites me more than good old legacy code. A code that can be improved light-years in a matter of few-days work. Not tedious and repetitive work. But with intelligent modern automated almost-futuristic tools.

My biggest passion is **to innovate in the area of "impossible" and help developers to be happier** :heart: at their daily work. If you're happy, you enjoy your work and life more, don't you? :wink:

## I Love to Share and Work

* :paintbrush:  I **blog weekly** about PHP and cool coding shortcuts at [tomasvotruba.com](https://tomasvotruba.com)
* :rocket: I work on [Rector](http://github.com/rectorphp/rector) to help you forget about technical debt and upgrade from PHP 5.6 to PHP 8.1 in a day :muscle:
* :book: I wrote a book about Rector - [The Power of Automated Refactoring](https://leanpub.com/rector-the-power-of-automated-refactoring) together with my childhood hero
* :family: I believe in personal sharing of knowledge, so I made [friendsofphp.org](https://friendsofphp.org) to cover all World PHP meetups next month
* :love: Do you **enjoy tasty fruits** of my work? Support me at [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/TomasVotruba) 
* :bird:  I **tweet** about ideas worth learning at [@votrubaT](https://twitter.com/votrubat)
